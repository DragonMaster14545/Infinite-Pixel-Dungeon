# Experienced Pixel Dungeon

Experienced Pixel Dungeon (Redone) is an open-source pretty grindy traditional roguelike dungeon sandbox with randomized levels, enemies and opportunities to abuse the game, and hundreds of items to collect and grind for. Its based on the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon), by [00-Evan](https://shatteredpixel.com).

Experienced Pixel Dungeon currently compiles for Android and Desktop platforms. You can find official releases of the game on:

The game also has *no* translation project hosted on Transifex.
